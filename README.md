**Fern Stack Amazon Clone Project**
This project aims to replicate the core functionality of Amazon using the Fern stack, including Firebase for authentication and Firestore for database management. Additionally, Stripe is integrated for payment processing.

**Setup**
**Firebase Setup**
**Create Firebase Project:**
Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.
**Set Up Authentication:**
Enable authentication methods like email/password, Google Sign-In, etc., in the Firebase console.
**Firestore Database:**
Create a Firestore database in the Firebase console and configure security rules.
Firebase Configuration:
Add your Firebase configuration to the project. You'll find this configuration in your Firebase project settings.
**Installation**
Clone the Repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fern-amazon-clone.git
cd fern-amazon-clone
**Install Dependencies:**


npm install
**Firestore Commands**
For Firestore setup and management, you can use the Firebase CLI:

**Install Firebase CLI:**

npm install -g firebase-tools
Login to Firebase:

firebase login
Deploy Firestore Rules:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
